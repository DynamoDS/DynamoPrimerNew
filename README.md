> Dynamo is an open source visual programming platform for designers.

### Welcome

You have just opened the Dynamo Primer, a comprehensive guide to visual programming in Autodesk Dynamo. This primer is an on-going project to share the fundamentals of programming. Topics include working with computational geometry, best practices for rules-based design, cross-disciplinary programming applications, and more with the Dynamo Platform.

The power of Dynamo can be found in a wide variety of design-related activities. Dynamo enables an expanding list of readily accessible ways for you to get started:

* **Explore** visual programming for the first time
* **Connect** workflows in various software
* **Engage** an active community of users, contributors, and developers
* **Develop** an open-source platform for continued improvement

In the midst of this activity and exciting opportunity for working with Dynamo, we need a document of the same caliber, the Dynamo Primer.

Refer to the [primer user guide](1_introduction/2-primer-user-guide-dynamo-community-and-platform.md) to find out what you can expect to learn from this primer.

We are continuously improving Dynamo, so some features may look different from what is represented in this Primer. However, all functionality changes will be correctly represented.

### Open Source
