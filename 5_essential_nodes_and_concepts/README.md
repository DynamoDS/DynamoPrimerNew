# Essential Nodes & Concepts

In this section, we introduce the essential Nodes available in the Dynamo Library that will help you create your own visual program like a pro.

[5-2\_geometry-for-computational-design](5-2\_geometry-for-computational-design/ "mention"): How do I work with geometric elements in Dynamo? Explore multiple ways to create simple or complex geometries from primitives.

[5-3\_the-building-blocks-of-programs](5-3\_the-building-blocks-of-programs/ "mention"): What is "Data" and what are some fundamental types I can start using in my programs? Also learn more about incorporating math and logic operations in your design workflow.

[5-4\_designing-with-lists](5-4\_designing-with-lists/ "mention"): How do I manage and coordinate my data structures? Understand more about the concept of List and use it to manage your design data efficiently.

[5-5\_dictionaries-in-dynamo](5-5\_dictionaries-in-dynamo/ "mention"): What are Dictionaries? Find out how to use dictionaries to look up specific data and values from existing results.
