# Dynamo for Revit

{% hint style="info" %}
**Revit Integration**: Dynamo is bundled with Revit 2020 and later. The version of Dynamo bundled with Revit depends on your Revit version. See the [Version Guide](../VERSION_GUIDE.md) and [Host Integration Map](../a_appendix/host-integration-map.md) for compatibility details.

While Dynamo is a flexible environment, designed to port into a wide range of programs, it was originally created for use with Revit. A visual program creates robust options for a Building Information Model (BIM). Dynamo offers a whole suite of nodes specifically designed for Revit, as well as third-party libraries from a thriving AEC community. This chapter focuses on the basics of using Dynamo in Revit.
