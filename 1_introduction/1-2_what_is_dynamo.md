### The Process

Dynamo enables us to work within a Visual Programming process wherein we connect elements together to define the relationships and the sequences of actions that compose custom algorithms. We can use our algorithms for a wide array of applications - from processing data to generating geometry - all in real time and without writing a lick of `code`.
