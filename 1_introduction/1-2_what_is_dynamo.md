# What is Dynamo and How Does It Work?

Dynamo is a [visual programming ](broken-reference)application that can be downloaded and run in either stand-alone "Sandbox" mode or as a plug-in for other software like Revit, FormIt or Civil 3D.

### The Process

Dynamo enables us to work within a Visual Programming process wherein we connect elements together to define the relationships and the sequences of actions that compose custom algorithms. We can use our algorithms for a wide array of applications - from processing data to generating geometry - all in real time and without writing a lick of `code`.

### Connecting Nodes and Wires

Use Wire to connect Nodes and define the relations between them.

### Primer User Guide

This guide is designed to cater to readers from different backgrounds and skill levels. General introduction about Dynamo setup, user interface and essential concepts can be found in the following sections, we recommend new users to cover these essential topics.

For users who would like to develop a more in-depth understanding on each element such as Nodes, we have a whole chapter that covers the concept behind each Node.

If you would like to see the demonstration of Dynamo workflows, we have included some graphs in the Sample Workflows section. Follow the attached instructions to create your own Dynamo graphs.

## The Community

Dynamo wouldn't be what it is without a strong group of avid users and active contributors. Engage the community by following the [Blog](http://dynamobim.org/blog/), adding your work to the Gallery, or discussing Dynamo in the [Forum](https://forum.dynamobim.com).

## The Platform

Dynamo is envisioned as a visual programming tool for designers, allowing us to make tools that make use of external libraries or any Autodesk product that has an API. With Dynamo Sandbox we can develop programs in a "Sandbox" style application - but the Dynamo ecosystem continues to grow.

The source code for the project is open-source, enabling us to extend its functionality to our hearts content. Check out the project on GitHub and browse the Works in Progress of users customizing Dynamo.
