Dynamo is a [visual programming ](broken-reference/)application that can be downloaded and run in either stand-alone "Sandbox" mode or as a plug-in for other software like Revit, FormIt or Civil 3D.

### The Process

Dynamo enables us to work within a Visual Programming process wherein we connect elements together to define the relationships and the sequences of actions that compose custom algorithms. We can use our algorithms for a wide array of applications - from processing data to generating geometry - all in real time and without writing a lick of `code`.

### Connecting Nodes and Wires

Use Wire to connect Nodes and define the relations between them.
