### The Community

Dynamo wouldn't be what it is without a strong group of avid users and active contributors. Engage the community by following the [Blog](http://dynamobim.org/blog/), adding your work to the Gallery, or discussing Dynamo in the [Forum](https://forum.dynamobim.com).

### The Platform

Dynamo is envisioned as a visual programming tool for designers, allowing us to make tools that make use of external libraries or any Autodesk product that has an API. With Dynamo Sandbox we can develop programs in a "Sandbox" style application - but the Dynamo ecosystem continues to grow.

The source code for the project is open-source, enabling us to extend its functionality to our hearts content. Check out the project on GitHub and browse the Works in Progress of users customizing Dynamo.
