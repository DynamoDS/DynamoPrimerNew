{% hint style="warning" %}
**Python Engine Versions**: Python support varies across Dynamo versions:
- **Dynamo 2.x - 3.x**: IronPython2 default (CPython/PythonNet3 available as engines)
- **Dynamo 4.x+**: PythonNet3 default for new nodes (backward compatible with IronPython2)

For migration guidance, see [Updating for Dynamo 4.x](../../11_developer_primer/3_developing_for_dynamo/6-2-updating-your-packages-and-dynamo-libraries-for-dynamo-4x.md)

​​Python is a widely-used programming language whose popularity has a lot to do with its style of syntax. It's highly readable, which makes it easier to learn than many other languages. Python supports modules and packages and can be embedded into existing applications. For information about how to get up and running with Python, a good resource is the ["Getting Started"](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) page on [Python.org](https://www.python.org)
