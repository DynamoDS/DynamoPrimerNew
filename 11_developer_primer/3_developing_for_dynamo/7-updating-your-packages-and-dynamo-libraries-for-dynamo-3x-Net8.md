This section contains information on issues you may encounter while migratring your graphs, packages and libraries to Dynamo 3.x

Dynamo 3.0 is a major release and some APIs have been changed or removed. The biggest change that is likely to affect you as a developer or user of Dynamo 3.x is the move to .NET8.

Dotnet/.NET is the runtime that powers the c# language that Dynamo is written in. We have updated to a modern version of this runtime along with the rest of the Autodesk ecosystem.
