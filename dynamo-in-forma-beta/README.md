Dynamo is available as an extension in Forma. At the moment, it comes in two flavors: a desktop-connected version, and a cloud-based integration as a closed beta. Read more about the desktop version in this [blog post](https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-in-forma/), and about the closed beta cloud integration in this [blog post](https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-as-a-service-powers-up-dynamo-player-in-forma/).

### What is Autodesk Forma?

Autodesk Forma is a cloud software that offers powerful, yet easy-to-use AI-powered tools for pre-design and schematic design. Architects and designers use Forma to model complex 3D designs in minutes, optimize living quality and sustainability through real-time environmental analysis, and continue the design process by fluidly connecting with Revit, Rhino, and Dynamo. You can learn more and start your free trial or purchase here: [Autodesk Forma](https://www.autodesk.com/products/forma/overview?term=1-YEAR\&tab=subscription). Forma is included as part of the AEC Collection. &#x20;

### What is Dynamo Player in Forma?

Dynamo Player is an extension that brings a variety of design automation capabilities to Forma users. Some key advantages of using Dynamo Player with Forma:&#x20;

* Streamlined Automation: Dynamo Player simplifies the process of automating repetitive tasks and workflows in Forma. Custom graphs created with Dynamoâ€™s visual programming environment can be executed directly within Forma with just a few clicks. The graphs are displayed as a list within Dynamo Player, making it easy to select and run them whenever needed. This streamlined process allows you to quickly execute repetitive tasks, reducing errors and boosting efficiency.&#x20;
* Easy-to-Use Interface: Dynamo Player provides a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible to Forma users, with no Dynamo expertise required. In the future, we plan on releasing more sample graphs that give you access to Dynamo-powered automations without having to rely on developers or advanced coding skills.
* Customizable Parameters: Dynamo Player allows you to define input parameters for your automation graphs, enabling you to customize graph behavior based on your specific project requirements. You can set up options and values that can be easily modified each time the graph is executed, providing flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios.&#x20;
* Reusability and Sharing: Dynamo Player promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among Forma users. Automation graphs can be saved and reused across multiple projects, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Additionally, you can share your scripts with others in the Forma community, enabling them to benefit from your automation solutions and vice versa.&#x20;
