# Set Up Dynamo Player in Forma

To use Dynamo with Forma, you have two options: cloud-based Dynamo as a Service (DaaS), or desktop Dynamo. Each has its benefits depending on what you want to do, so before you get started, consider which option best serves your needs. However, keep in mind that you can switch between these options at any time.
