# Sample Workflows

Roads, railways, land, utilities, surveying, GIS...

Civil infrastructure is all of these things, and more! This section contains several practical and relevant example graphs to help propel you towards Dynamo mastery and unlock the full potential of Dynamo for Civil 3D. Each graph comes complete with detailed descriptions of the logic that went into creating it so that you can not only _use_ it, but _understand_ it.

Furthermore, these examples embody time-tested best practices for building strong graphs. As you work through the examples, we encourage you to also familiarize yourself with the [9\_best\_practices](../../9\_best\_practices/ "mention") section for more ideas on how to build powerful, flexible, and maintainable graphs.
