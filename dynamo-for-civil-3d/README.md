# Dynamo for Civil 3D

While Dynamo was originally built with Revit in mind, its versatility as a visual programming tool extends beyond Revit. **Dynamo is also integrated into Civil 3D**, giving users the ability to create powerful automation routines for civil infrastructure projects. It is an extremely useful tool for processing anything from common tasks to the most complex design workflows, ultimately helping you save time, optimize your designs, and make better design decisions. Dynamo offers a whole suite of nodes specifically designed for Civil 3D, as well as third-party libraries from a thriving community.

This chapter of the Primer will focus on Dynamo for Civil 3D, starting with the basics and working up to more advanced topics.
