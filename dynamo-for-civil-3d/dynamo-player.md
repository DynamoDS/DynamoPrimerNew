**Dynamo Player** provides a simplified way to run Dynamo graphs in Civil 3D. Once a graph has been created, **no Dynamo expertise is required** to use the Player and run the graphs. This makes it easy to share graphs with others that might not be interested in digging into the details of nodes and wires.
